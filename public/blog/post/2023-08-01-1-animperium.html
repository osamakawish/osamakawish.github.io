  I have, in recent years, been trying to make animation applications,
  particularly pertaining to math. However, desktop applications for animating
  math simply enough simply don't exist, at least not with LaTeX integrated into
  the application. So initially, my main goal was to create a simple desktop
  application with the ability to generate math equations via LaTeX syntax.
  However, I later realized that an apporach like would attract a very niche
  audience - as there are many other applications for which desktop applications
  for animations annd video editing simply don't exist for, such as an
  application for making education videos in biology.

  The next question becomes: "How do I make an application that serves various
  purposes, but is still simple to use?", after all, I also wanted to make it
  easier for other teachers to make their videos. The solution I came up with
  was to have a community-oriented store such as that in the Steam application,
  where users can upload their own mods and plugins for the application. This
  will open room for a lot of flexibility.

  The purpose of this animation application is to create a bridge between more
  simpler animation applications and more complex animation applications. The
  application is designed to be simple to use, but also to be able to create
  complex animations.
