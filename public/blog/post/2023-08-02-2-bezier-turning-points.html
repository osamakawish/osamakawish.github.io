  In graphics applications, it is mainly Cubic Bezier curves that are used.
  Cubic Bezier curves are defined by the following equation:
</p>
<p>
  \[ \mathbf{B}(t) = (1-t)^3 \mathbf{P}_0 + 3(1-t)^2t \mathbf{Q}_0 +
  3(1-t)t^2\mathbf{Q}_1 + t^3\mathbf{P}_1 \]
</p>
<p>
  These are two dimensional curves that go from a point \(\mathbf{P}_0\) to some
  other point \(\mathbf{P}_1\). The points \(\mathbf{Q}_0\) and \(\mathbf{Q}_1\)
  are the control points, and they manipulate the shape of the curve.
</p>
<p>
  When trying to code vector shapes such as Bezier curves, computing their
  bounding rectangle is important, as this allows the graphics computations to
  efficient understand where to begin evaluating the curve and its coloring
  from. If it didn't have a boundary rectangle, then each individual pixel on
  the screen would have to be checked to see it's part of the curve or not.
  Furthermore, these bounding rectangle computations are also used to determine
  the selection rectangle for when the curve is selected, or if its bounds are
  within the bounds of the selection attempted by the cursor.
</p>
<p>
  To compute the bounding rectangle, we find the turning points of the curve.
  These are the points where the derivative of the curve is zero. The derivative
  of the cubic bezier is:
</p>
<p>
  \[ \begin{align*} \mathbf{B}'(t) & = -3(1-t)^2 \mathbf{P}_0 + 3( -2(1-t)t +
  (1-t)^2 ) \mathbf{Q}_0 + 3( -t^2 + 2t(1-t) )\mathbf{Q}_1 + 3t^2\mathbf{P}_1 \\
  & = -3(1-t)^2 \mathbf{P}_0 + 3( -2t + t^2 + t^2 - 2t + 1 ) \mathbf{Q}_0 +
  3(-t^2 +2t - 2t^2) \mathbf{Q}_1 + 3t^2\mathbf{P}_1 \\ & = (-3t^2 +6t -3)
  \mathbf{P}_0 + ( 6t^2 -12t + 3 ) \mathbf{Q}_0 + (-9t^2 +6t) \mathbf{Q}_1 +
  3t^2\mathbf{P}_1 \\ & = (-3\mathbf{P}_0 + 6\mathbf{Q}_0 - 9\mathbf{Q}_1 +
  3\mathbf{P}_1)t^2 + (6\mathbf{P}_0 - 12\mathbf{Q}_0 + 6 \mathbf{Q}_1 )t +
  (-3\mathbf{P}_0 + 3\mathbf{Q}_0) \\ & = 3[(-\mathbf{P}_0 + 2\mathbf{Q}_0 -
  3\mathbf{Q}_1 + \mathbf{P}_1)t^2 + 2(\mathbf{P}_0 - 2\mathbf{Q}_0 +
  \mathbf{Q}_1 )t + (-\mathbf{P}_0 + \mathbf{Q}_0)] \\ & = 3[\mathbf{A}t^2 +
  2\mathbf{B} t + \mathbf{C}] \end{align*} \] where $\mathbf{A}$, $\mathbf{B}$
  and $\mathbf{C}$ are the vector coefficients simplfied from their respected
  brackets:
</p>
<p>
  \[ \begin{align*} \mathbf{A} & = -\mathbf{P}_0 + 2\mathbf{Q}_0 - 3\mathbf{Q}_1
  + \mathbf{P}_1 \\ \mathbf{B} & = \mathbf{P}_0 - 2\mathbf{Q}_0 + \mathbf{Q}_1
  \\ \mathbf{C} & = -\mathbf{P}_0 + \mathbf{Q}_0 \end{align*} \]
</p>
<p>
  From this simplification, we have a quadratic formula which will be computed
  through element-wise vector operations. That is, products of two vectors will
  be defined as $(a_x, a_y) \cdot (b_x, b_y) = (a_xb_x, a_yb_y)$, as opposed to
  either the dot product or cross product. This is because this definition is
  simply more convenient for our derivation. We similarly define an element-wise
  division of vectors, for the duration of this derivation: $(a_x, a_y) / (b_x,
  b_y) = (a_x/b_x, a_y/b_y)$.
</p>
<p>By the quadratic formula, we want that $\mathbf{B}'(t) = 0$, so we have:</p>
<p>
  \[ \begin{align*} 0 & = 3[\mathbf{A}t^2 + 2\mathbf{B} t + \mathbf{C}] \\ 0 & =
  \mathbf{A}t^2 + 2\mathbf{B} t + \mathbf{C} \\ 0 & = t^2 + 2
  \frac{\mathbf{B}}{\mathbf{A}}t + \frac{ \mathbf{C} }{ \mathbf{A} } = t^2 + 2
  \mathbf{B}^* t + \mathbf{C}^* \end{align*} \]
</p>
<p>
  where $\mathbf{B}^* = \mathbf{B} / \mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{C}^* = \mathbf{C}
  / \mathbf{A}$. We'll complete the square to simplify:
</p>
<p>
  \[ \begin{align*} 0 & = (t + \mathbf{B}^*)^2 - (\mathbf{B}^*)^2 + \mathbf{C}^*
  \\ (t + \mathbf{B}^*)^2 & = (\mathbf{B}^*)^2 - \mathbf{C}^* \\ t & =
  \mathbf{B}^* \pm \sqrt{ (\mathbf{B}^*)^2 - \mathbf{C}^* } = \frac{\mathbf{B}
  \pm \sqrt{ \mathbf{B}^2 - \mathbf{AC} }}{\mathbf{A}} \end{align*} \]
</p>
<p>
  Let's clarify what it is we've done this for. This above derivation will give
  us 4 separate equations for $t$, two for the horizontal turning points, and
  two for the vertical turning points. We then compare these turning points with
  $\mathbf{P}_0$ and $\mathbf{P}_1$ to find the minimum and maximum values for
  the curve. The turning points, can be paired up for the $x$ and $y$
  coordinates to give us vector equations.
</p>
<p>
  Since the $t$ values will essentially give us the turning points of the Bezier
  curve, one pair for each coordinate, let us rewrite it in terms of a vector
  $\mathbf{T}$:
</p>
<p>
  \[ \mathbf{T} = \frac{\mathbf{B} \pm \sqrt{ \mathbf{B}^2 - \mathbf{AC}
  }}{\mathbf{A}} \]
</p>
<p>
  Not much of a change, besides the fact we're now looking at system of two
  equations which we've condensed into vector form. Again, keep in mind all
  arithmetic operations here are just element-wise vector operations on numbers:
  the subtractions, additions, square roots, products, and divisions.
</p>
<p>Now to simplify $\mathbf{T}$:</p>
<p>
  \[ \begin{align*} \mathbf{B}^2 & = ( \mathbf{P}_0 - 2\mathbf{Q}_0 +
  \mathbf{Q}_1 )^2 = ( \mathbf{P}_0 - 2\mathbf{Q}_0 + \mathbf{Q}_1 )(
  \mathbf{P}_0 - 2\mathbf{Q}_0 + \mathbf{Q}_1 ) \\ & = (\mathbf{P}_0^2 -
  2\mathbf{P}_0\mathbf{Q}_0 + \mathbf{P}_0\mathbf{Q}_1)
  -2(\mathbf{P}_0\mathbf{Q}_0 - 2\mathbf{Q}_0^2 + \mathbf{Q}_0\mathbf{Q}_1) +
  (\mathbf{Q}_1\mathbf{P}_0 ) \end{align*} \]
</p>

<p>
  \[ \begin{align*} \mathbf{T} & = \frac{\mathbf{B} \pm \sqrt{ \mathbf{B}^2 -
  \mathbf{AC} }}{\mathbf{A}} \\ & = \frac{ (\mathbf{P}_0 - 2\mathbf{Q}_0 +
  \mathbf{Q}_1) \pm \sqrt{ (\mathbf{P}_0 - 2\mathbf{Q}_0 + \mathbf{Q}_1)^2 -
  (-\mathbf{P}_0 + 2\mathbf{Q}_0 - 3\mathbf{Q}_1 + \mathbf{P}_1) (-\mathbf{P}_0
  + \mathbf{Q}_0) } }{ -\mathbf{P}_0 + 2\mathbf{Q}_0 - 3\mathbf{Q}_1 +
  \mathbf{P}_1 } \end{align*} \]
