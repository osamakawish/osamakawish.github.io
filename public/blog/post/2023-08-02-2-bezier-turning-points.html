  In graphics applications, it is mainly Cubic Bezier curves that are used.
  Cubic Bezier curves are defined by the following equation:
</p>
<p>
  \[ \mathbf{B}(t) = (1-t)^3 \mathbf{P}_0 + 3(1-t)^2t \mathbf{Q}_0 +
  3(1-t)t^2\mathbf{Q}_1 + t^3\mathbf{P}_1 \]
</p>
<p>
  These are two dimensional curves that go from a point \(\mathbf{P}_0\) to some
  other point \(\mathbf{P}_1\). The points \(\mathbf{Q}_0\) and \(\mathbf{Q}_1\)
  are the control points, and they manipulate the shape of the curve.
</p>

  When trying to code vector shapes such as Bezier curves, computing their
  bounding rectangle is important, as this allows the graphics computations to
  efficient understand where to begin evaluating the curve and its coloring
  from. If it didn't have a boundary rectangle, then each individual pixel on
  the screen would have to be checked to see it's part of the curve or not.
