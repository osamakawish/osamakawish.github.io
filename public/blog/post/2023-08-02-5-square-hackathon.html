  When I applied for the Square Hackathon in June 2023 via DevPost, I had a very
  little understanding of the Square API or Hackathons in general. I had past
  experience implementing public APIs, but never for a full-scale project that I
  also had to publish. I had no clue how to publish an application, no clue how
  to use the Square API, but I decided to take on the challenge in the hopes of
  seeing what I can do and learn anyways. And although the project was
  completely unsuccessful at achieving what I wanted, I learned a lot from the
  experience.
</p>
<p>
  When I found out about the Hackathon, I had 40 days to build my project,
  publish it, make a short YouTube video about it, all of which had proven to be
  incredibly challenging, but again, something that I learned a lot from.
  However, I managed to build an application that could accumulate inventory
  data manually for the user.
</p>
<p>
  Taking on the challenge was a fun experience. The application that I planned
  to make had to be useful, and I had to use modern technologies in some way, as
  that was the entire purpose of the Hackathon. My integration with the Square
  API was a simple inventory system, but one which could be manipulated through
  a voice assistant.
</p>
<p>
  Since I only had 40 days to work on it, I had to stick to what I knew as much
  as possible. So I decided to go with WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for
  making the application, and C# as my programming language. This is a framework
  that I've become well adapted to and know how to use for the purposes of
  making a desktop application.
</p>
<p>
  So, I got to work on the application and first developed a basic manual
  inventory system for the desktop using the Square API's sandbox system. I had
  to learn and implement the Square API, which was entirely new to me. In fact,
  it was the first e-commerce API I had ever worked with. The system was
  different, as the API uses classes for CatalogObjects, which are used
  essentially everywhere. However, the solid thing is that it was
  well-documented.
</p>
<p>
  During the development of this manual component, I had to learn to construct
  "catalog items," which are, as you'd expect, items that are in your
  inventory/catalog. The issue that I ran into here was that creating a catalog
  item had some required parameters, and it wasn't completely well-documented as
  to what these required parameters were. For example, you need at least one
  item variation to create a catalog item in the Square API, but this wasn't
  mentioned in the documentation, and so I had to figure it out the hard way.
  This was the first of many hurdles that I had to overcome.
</p>
<p>
  The next hurdle was debugging the API connection, as there were various
  requirements regarding how the id had to be passed to the API. For example,
  when a CatalogObject id is defined for the first time, it is preceded by a
  hash "#". Secondly, the API then modifies this id and turns it into a random
  arrangement of letters and numbers, which you then have to retrieve. This was
  a bit confusing at first, but I managed to figure it out.
</p>
<p>
  All this, and we have only covered the manual component of the API. Note the
  underlying complexity here: Before you could even <i>submit</i> a catalog
  object, there were numerous different requirements that had to be met that
  weren't clearly specified by the API. Combined with the string formatting
  requirements for ids, for example, just learning the API was a challenge in
  itself.
</p>
<p>
  The next component was the voice assistant. I had to learn how to use the
  speech-to-text services provided by Microsoft Azure for two reasons: (1) it
  allowed me to debug the voice assistant and how it was interpreting the
  speech, and (2) I was able to use it to caption the text.
</p>
<p>
  I had very little time left to implement the voice assistant and very little
  experience with cloud services such as Azure. This, combined with the fact
  that the challenge required all submissions to post publicly shared videos to
  go with our submissions, meant that I had to publish what I could, make the
  video, and republish it as quickly as possible. In this timeframe, I also had
  to learn to publish a desktop application, which I had also never done before.
</p>
<p>
  I quickly hashed together a simple YouTube video for the submission, and got
  going on the recording services. The main hurdle implementing the speech
  services was to figure out how to encrypt the keys that were used in the
  application. The approach I used was to keep it simple by using environment
  variables. These are not perfectly safe, but security wasn't the purpose of
  the application, and I had to get it done quickly.
</p>
<p>
  Then came the point in which I had to implement the audio itself. I first had
  to simply test the audio and see how it would play out. I learned to use Azure
  speech-to-text services, but ran into one final hurdle: the audio was
  misinterpreting what I was saying completely. I was using a fairly advanced
  microphone, and I made sure to record myself and listened to my own audio to
  ensure I was speaking clearly. However, the speech-to-text services were still
  not getting the audio right.
</p>
<p>
  Trying to fix this issue took several days, and I never managed to get it to
  work. I definitely didn't have time to switch to a different speech-to-text
  service. I published what I had and submitted it to the Square Hackathon. I
  was disappointed that I couldn't get the voice assistant to work, but I
  learned a lot from the experience.
