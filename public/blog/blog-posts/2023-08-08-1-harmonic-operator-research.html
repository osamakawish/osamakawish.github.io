<p>Let's define the following operator:</p>
<p>\[ x * y = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y}} = \frac{xy}{x+y} \]</p>
<p>In the $x = 0$ or $y = 0$ case, we'll define the following for all $x$:</p>
<p>\[ x * 0 = 0 \]</p>
<!-- Reference the oplus operator from 3b1b's video. -->
<!-- What about two complex numbers? How do they behave? -->
<!-- Consider how to implement this in code: eg. in binary rep, how would you evaluate this? -->
<!-- Easy in floating point: inverses = negative exponent, then add, then do negative exponent again   -->
