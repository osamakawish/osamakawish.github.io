<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Throughout this proof, I will not use the \( re^{i\theta} \) formulation of
  complex coordinates, to keep things straightforward. The goal here is to
  develop a construction that could have been developed before such a
  formulation was known.
</p>
<p>
  I prefer to make this proof as "primitive" as possible, for a variety of
  reasons:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>It develops an intuition regarding complex multiplication,</li>
  <li>
    It shows that if complex numbers were discovered earlier, that
    multiplication of complex numbers could still have been defined the way we
    use them today.
  </li>
  <li>
    It will allow for an earlier introduction to complex multiplication in
    education, which may prove to be useful.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  For these reasons, I prefer to refrain from using concepts that are too
  advanced, such as trigonometric functions or matrix multiplication - or at
  least I will not rely on those concepts directly. I will mention matrices
  briefly however, only to make the connection between the Euclidean
  construction of the product of complex numbers, and the usual algebraic
  product that we use. The use of linear transformation severely simplifies the
  proof.
</p>
<h2>Notation</h2>
<p>
  Lines in complex plane will be denotes via a pair of complex numbers \( (x, y)
  \), where both \( x \) and \( y \) are complex. This denotes the line from \(
  x \) to \( y \).
</p>
<p>
  The length of a line \( (x,y) \), or it's distance from the origin of the
  complex plane \( O(0,0) \), is denoted \( |(x,y)| \).
</p>
<p>
  Triangles will be denoted with 3 complex numbers \( \triangle(x, y, z) \).
  Again, the 3 variables are the vertices defining the triangle.
</p>
<p>
  Similarity of triangles is stated via "\( \sim \)": \( \triangle(u,v,w) \sim
  \triangle(x,y,z) \).
</p>
<p>
  Congruency is declared via "\( \cong \)": \( \triangle(u,v,w) \cong
  \triangle(x,y,z) \).
</p>
<p>
  Functions are declared via the usual notation \( F(x)=y \). Specific mappings
  of a function will use the notation \( F:a\mapsto b \).
</p>
<h2>Underlying Intuition</h2>
<p>
  The intuition remains much the same as the computing the product of real
  numbers via classical Euclidean Geometry: To compute \( a\cdot b \), create a
  linear mapping \( T \) such that \( T:1\mapsto a \). Then apply the same
  linear mapping to \( b \). The main difference: our attention is towards
  complex numbers rather than real numbers.
</p>
<p>
  Recall that any linear mapping \( T \) conserves scaling (ie. \( T(x) \) such
  that \( T(cx)=cT(x) \)). If \( T \) maps \( T:1\mapsto a \), then it also maps
  \( T:b\mapsto ab \) since \( T(b)=T(1\cdot b)=T(1)\cdot b = ab \). Euclidean
  constructions that multiply lengths of line segments focus on producing such
  transformations. I am applying this logic to complex numbers, but working with
  Euclidean constructions to make things straightforward and as elementary as
  possible.
</p>
<p>
  It is this geometric definition that I will provide that I believe is more
  fitting to cover our modern notion of multiplication, one that includes
  complex numbers.

<h2>Algebraic Proof of Construction</h2>
<p>
  Claim: \( z=a\cdot b \). That is, \( z \) is the complex product of the
  numbers \( a=a_0 + ia_1 \) and \( b=b_0 + ib_1 \) in the complex plane. More
  specifically,
</p>
<p class="math-block">
  \[ z=ab=(a_0+ia_1)(b_0+ib_1)=(a_0b_0 -a_1b_1) + i(a_1b_0 + a_0b_1) \]
</p>
<p>
  Although the Euclidean construction in the previous section can be treated as
  a definition, I'd like to ensure that it corresponds to our usual notion of a
  product of two complex numbers.
</p>
<p>
  This proof will first determine a linear transformation \( T \) such as \(
  T:1\mapsto a \) (which will capture the rotation and scaling simultaneously -
  as opposed to in individual steps as in the construction).
</p>
<p>The transformation will take the following form:</p>
<span class="math-block"> \[ T(x,y) = (Ax-By, Bx+Ay) \] </span>
<p>
  I will ignore proving that this preserves scaling and rotations as that can be
  covered in linear algebra courses, given that this corresponds to the
  transformation matrix corresponding to a scaling and rotation combined:
</p>
<span class="math-block">
  \[ \begin{pmatrix} A & -B \\ B & A \end{pmatrix} = (A^2 + B^2) \begin{pmatrix}
  \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \]
</span>
<p>
  Using a function \(T:\mathbf{R}^2\to\mathbf{R}^2\) as defined by \(T(x,y)\)
  rather than a scaled rotation matrix allows us to skip the need for
  introducing trigonometry or linear algebra, as the same linear transformation
  involving rotations and scaling was applied on all 3 points of
  \(\triangle(0,1,b)\).
</p>
<p>
  Returning to the proof, we first map \(1\mapsto a=(a_0,a_1)\) (as done in the
  construction):
</p>
<span class="math-block"> \[ T(1,0) = (A-0,B+0) = (A,B) = (a_0, a_1) \] </span>
<p>This gives us our coefficients. Thus:</p>
<span class="math-block"> \[ T(x,y) = (a_0x - a_1y, a_1x + a_0y) \] </span>
<p>Applying it to \(b\):</p>
<span class="math-block">
  \[ T(b_0, b_1) = (a_0b_0 - a_1b_1, a_1b_0 + a_0b_1) \]
</span>
<p>
  In the complex plane, this corresponds to \(z=(a_0b_0 -a_1b_1) + i(a_1b_0 +
  a_0b_1)\), which is what we desired.
</p>
