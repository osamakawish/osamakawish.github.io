# How to become a programmer

Programming is about manipulating stuff on your computer. And by stuff I mean literally all sorts of things, only to an extent which is possible for the computer, of course. I mean, you can't manipulate your computer's speed or how much memory it has. That's beyond your control.

But you can manipulate all sorts of information. You can get a table of data and compute important results, like the sum of all values in a certain column, or their mean or variance, if you're into that statistics stuff.

## Learn what programming can do

Like I said, programming is about manipulating stuff. And the kind of stuff a specific *programming language* can manipulate depends on which programming language we're talking about. Some can manipulate web content, others manipulate information and data, others move them around. Then you have the shell scripting languages on computers which manipulate the data about your computer itself.
